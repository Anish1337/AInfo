# AInfo
The goal of this project is to crete an organized library of machine learning concepts by: 
* Converting notes (text and images) into a website format, for:
    * Computer Vision
    * NLP
    * Deep Learning
    * Supervised Learning
    * Unsupervised Learning
    * Math Review
    * Academic Paper Summaries
* Format the website (design).
* Add useful functions (searching, runnable code.

## Changelog
### 25/05/2021
* Found notes I previously had on CNN's, RNN's, LSTM's, GloVe, and Eigenfaces.
* Reviewed the basics of html.
* TODO: Convert the notes to pages in a basic html website


### 27/05/2021
* Created a basic html page with a menu bar and drop downs.
* Need to add the notes to their respective page on the website.
* Github is not rendering the html file as a website will fix.

### 29/05/2021
* Renamed main.html to header.php
* Used MAMP to view php files from localhost
* Website now has a static header across all sub pages.
* TODO: Paste the text from the notes to the subpages

### 30/05/2021
* Added sample text to subpage (CNN.php)
* Setup Github Desktop
* TODO: Organize the text and add images.

### 31/05/2021
* Formatted notes for the CNN page (headers, subheaders, newlines)
* TODO: Add pictures and citations!

### 02/06/2021
* Setup Github pages (converterd php to js code to display header)
* Fixed images not loading.
* TODO: Change image size, upload more images, finish up CNN page

### 03/06/2021
* Added more images to CNN notes, (some images still need to be resized)
* Added changes to github.io so that website can be viewed.
* TODO: Clean up images/layout and begind next notes. Also make home page look better.

### 10/06/2021
* Began transferring notes for RNN (Deep Learning) and Matricies (Math Review).
* TODO: Cite images, add to gradient descent notes, add to home page.
